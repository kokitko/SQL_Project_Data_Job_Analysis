## Project Overview

This project aims to answer the following questions about software engineering jobs:

- **Top Paying Jobs**: What are the top-paying software engineering roles?
- **Skills Required for High-Paying Jobs**: What skills are needed for these top-paying roles?
- **Most In-Demand Skills**: What are the most sought-after skills for software engineers?
- **Highest Paying Skills**: Which skills are associated with the highest average salaries?
- **Optimal Skills for Learning**: Which skills offer the best combination of demand and high salary?

Using these insights, this project offers guidance to software engineers on which skills to develop for both financial and career advancement.

## Data Structure

This project uses a star schema with the following tables:

- `company_dim`: Stores information about companies posting jobs.
- `skills_dim`: Lists individual skills and their categories.
- `job_postings_fact`: Contains job postings data, including job titles, locations, salaries, and additional job characteristics.
- `skills_job_dim`: Connects skills to job postings, allowing for analysis of which jobs require specific skills.
